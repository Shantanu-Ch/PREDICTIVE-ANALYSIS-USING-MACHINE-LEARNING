# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict house prices based on various features of residential properties using a regression-based machine learning model.

**Dataset Overview:**

* Rows: 545

* Columns: 13 (including target price)

**Features Include:**

* Numerical: area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking

* Categorical: mainroad, guestroom, basement, hotwaterheating, airconditioning, prefarea, furnishingstatus

**Workflow Summary:**

**Data Preprocessing**

* Handled missing values (if any)

* Converted categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding

* Feature scaling where necessary

**Feature Selection**

* Selected relevant variables to improve model performance

**Model Building**

* Used Linear Regression for predicting house prices

* Split data into training and test sets (e.g., 80-20 split)

**Model Evaluation**

**Evaluated model using metrics:**

* RÂ² Score

* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

* Mean Squared Error (MSE)

* Visualized Actual vs Predicted Prices

**Outcome:**

* Built a functional predictive model

* Gained insights into which features influence price the most

* Demonstrated ability to train, evaluate, and visualize a regression model on real-world data
